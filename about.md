### The Author 
My name is William James. I am the founder and chief executive of EHI (Existential Heroism Institute).

I created EHI in response to the [(*meta-crisis*)](https://metacrisis.org/META-CRISIS/00.+%F0%9F%91%8B+About/Start+Here). I am working to establish EHI as a non-profit orginization in the US that focuses on the solutions to the meta-crisis that other thinkers may not have considered, or have found too foolish to dedicate their own time. It is my hope that in coordination with the other actors activelt working to resolve the meta-crisis, that the team of fools at EHI can design and deploy complementary solutions. When integrated the stack of other solutions being implemented we hope to function as a singnal amplifier that shifts attention to meaningful work and away from what functions as useless noise.

### Our story

Inspire by the writings of Ernest Becker, our team of fools looks to harness a deep understanding of the human condition to improve it for all. We work across a maxamized domain of time and space as we relentlessly wage war against the forces of entrophy.
