### Mission Statement
The Existential Heroism Institute provides strategic analysis for world-scale issues along with research, reports, and educational materials to support social and environmental solutions. EHI was founded in response to the [*meta-crisis*](https://metacrisis.org/META-CRISIS/00.+%F0%9F%91%8B+About/Start+Here). We look to generate various designs of "third-attractor state" models that factor in the metacrisis as a set of design constraints. Knowing the difficulty of this task, we look to provide both the psychological grounding and cognitive toolkits that this task requires of others. Whether it is incentivised from a place of aiding humanity, or simply for achieving ideal psychological health, the development of the individual into an *existential hero* is a needed response for the predicaments faced today. Inspired by the writings of many great thinkers, our team looks to harness a deep understanding of the human condition to improve it for all.
