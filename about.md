subtitle: What is the Existential Heroism Institute?
---
### Description
Existential Heroism Institute provides strategic analysis for world-scale issues along with research, reports, and educational materials to support social and environmental solutions. EHI was founded in response to the [*meta-crisis*](https://metacrisis.org/META-CRISIS/00.+%F0%9F%91%8B+About/Start+Here). We look to generate various designs of "third-attractor state" models that factors in the metacrisis as a set of design constraints. Knowing the difficulty of this task, we look to provide both the psychological grounding and cognitive toolkits that this task requires to others. Weather it is incentivised from a place of aiding humanity, or simply fof achieving ideal psychological health, the development of the individual into an *existential hero* is a needed response for the predicaments faced today.   

### Our story
Inspired by the writings of Ernest Becker, our team looks to harness a deep understanding of the human condition to improve it for all. We work across a maximized domain of time and space as we relentlessly wage war against the forces of entropy.
